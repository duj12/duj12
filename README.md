👋 Hi, I'm @duj12, a graduate from Tsinghua University's Department of Engineering Physics.

👀 My research interests lie in Speech and Spoken Language Processing, Understanding, and Generation.

🌱 My primary focus areas include Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Keyword Spotting (KWS), and Language Modeling.

⏳ Currently, I'm actively working on Text-to-Speech (TTS), Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis, and Voice Cloning technologies.

💞️ I look forward to collaborating and exchanging ideas in fields such as deep learning, generative artificial intelligence, and large language models (LLMs).
